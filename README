To Install:
Move the files to the appropriate directory in your oscommerce store.

This integration of OSCommerce into the Samurai payment gateway uses the Transparent Redirect method of integration.  
Transparent redirect gives you full control over the payment flow and look and feel without requiring you to 
store payment information on your server -- the benefit of that is to remove your servers from PCI Scope. 
 With this integration into Samurai, all you need to achieve PCI compliance is to fill out a Self Assessment Questionnaire.

This plugin includes the Samurai PHP client library, which is contained within the samurai-client-php directory of the 
payments directory.  

This plugin will be uploaded to the oscommerce site, but the latest version will always be available at: 
https://github.com/FeeFighters/samurai-oscommerce-2-3. When used from github please notice that the PHP library
is incorporated as a git submodule so you must run git submodule init; git submodule update to pull it down.
